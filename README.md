Crop Prediction Model

An AI/ML-based Crop Prediction System that helps farmers, agricultural analysts, and policymakers determine the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and environmental conditions. This model leverages machine learning algorithms trained on agricultural datasets to provide accurate and data-driven crop recommendations.

@@ Features

@@ Accurate Crop Recommendations — Predicts the best crop based on soil nutrients and climate parameters.

@@ Machine Learning Models — Implements algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, or Logistic Regression.

@@ AI-Driven Insights — Learns from large datasets of soil and weather parameters.

@@ Dynamic Environmental Inputs — Supports inputs like NPK values, temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

@@ User-Friendly Interface — Flask web interface for users to input data and view results instantly.

@@ Database Integration (Optional) — Store prediction history using MySQL or SQLite.

@@ Visualization Support — Graphs and analytics for better decision-making.

@@ Tech Stack

@@ How It Works

User Input: Enter soil and environmental parameters (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall).

Model Processing: The ML model processes inputs and predicts the best crop for the given conditions.

Result Output: The system displays the most suitable crop recommendation and related information.

@@ Machine Learning Pipeline

Data Collection: Dataset containing soil and weather conditions with corresponding crop labels.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, and normalization of dataset features.

Model Training: Algorithms like Random Forest or Decision Tree are trained using scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed.

Deployment: Model is saved using pickle or joblib and integrated with a Flask backend.
